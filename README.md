# NodeJS Crawler Sample

A sample 12306 crawler in NodeJS which:
1. simulates user interaction (i.e. click)
2. fetches data in parallel

You don't need to know any APIs about the website.

P.S. to get the `selector path` of a webpage element  
(i.e. `'#t-list > table > tbody > tr'`), use the Inspector in Chrome  
to select "Copy > Copy Selector".

## usage
1. install (latest) node: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `node index.js`
